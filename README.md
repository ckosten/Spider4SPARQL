# PostgreSQL compatible data dumps & schemas
The 20 Spider dev databases and 146 train databases have been converted from sqlite to PostgreSQL compatible databases. [Link to the zip file with the PostgreSQL dumps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RzAlsws2FDCJcv_HKfXttGZzBT3Ah-hJ/view?usp=sharing).

It is important to note that both the databases and developement set SQL queries have been improved and are now conformant with PostgreSQL and best practices in data base design.
